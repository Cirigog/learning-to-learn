//]]></script><p>We hope that the activities in this section have helped you to bring to mind what you have learned. But we also want you to think about whether you have done anything differently from what you might have tried before starting the unit. In other words, we want you to ask yourself whether the unit has given you the confidence, or some ideas that have encouraged you, to take a bit of a risk, or, as Section 4 puts it, to step outside your comfort zone.</p><p>Do not worry if you cannot say that you have yet. We hope that you will feel able to do this in the near future. If you have tried something new, have a go at the next activity. If you have yet to do this, you should go on to Activity 58 (in Section 5.6).</p><div class="&#10;            oucontent-activity&#10;           oucontent-s-heavybox1 oucontent-s-box " id="act057"><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><h2 class="oucontent-h3 oucontent-nonumber">Activity 57 When I tried something new</h2><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><div class="oucontent-saq-timing">Allow about 20 minutes for this activity</div><div class="oucontent-saq-question"><p>Write down what you have done that was new or different.

This activity asks you to do just that.</p></div></div></div></div><p>You may have noticed that we have not commented on all activities in this section. This is deliberate, as we feel that if you are completing these activities then you will be demonstrating to yourself that you have, indeed, been able to bring about change in some way or another.
