There are two main reasons why this is important if you are going to use learning in order to achieve change. First, it is really important for you to have the self-confidence to know that you can achieve change. The activities in this section have been designed to provide you with opportunities to build up this much clearer picture. Another important aspect of this section is to help you to appreciate the value of qualities and skills that seem unimportant, insignificant or commonplace.</p><p>It is also important to &#x2018;knowâ€™ yourself better because this is the basis for communicating to others what changes you want to make in your life. The unit has already used the example of a job interview. In this situation, it is important to show that what you can do already is the basis for the change involved in taking on a new job. This is just one example; any projected change will involve other people in some way or another.</p><p>Section 3 focuses on how other people can be involved in using learning to achieve personal change. It shows that it is possible to add to the information we have about ourselves in two main ways:</p><ol class="oucontent-numbered"><li style="list-style-type:decimal">By asking people we know for feedback on our qualities, knowledge and skills.</li><li style="list-style-type:decimal">By drawing on ideas that academic writers have put forward about learning.</li></ol>
