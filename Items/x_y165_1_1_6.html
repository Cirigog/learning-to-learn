To save you looking back, the aims of Section 1 were to:</p><ul class="oucontent-bulleted"><li>provide you with a clear idea of what the unit is about and how it is structured</li><li>give you a better understanding about what it is going to be like to be a student on this unit</li><li>help you understand the importance of the word &#x2018;skills’</li><li>start you thinking about your own learning.</li></ul><p>It would be useful to think back over this list before moving on to Section 2 to see if you feel that these goals have been achieved. Sections 1.1 and 1.2 explain what the unit is about and how it is structured. So, in addition to your mind map, you could look at your notes on these sections. Section 1.3 focused on the importance of active involvement on this unit, so you could think back about how active you have been. For example: have you given yourself time for the activities or have you worked out when and where you are going to study? Some of the activities in Section 1 relate to working out what is meant by &#x2018;skills’ on this unit. You could check whether you understand which skills play a part in <i>Learning to learn.</i> Finally, and perhaps most importantly, have you begun to reflect on your own learning?</p>
