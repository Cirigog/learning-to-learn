You share ideas and experiences and find shortcuts to what is expected of you, rather than the more formal work-based learning and training programmes that teach you what management wants you to know and do.</p><p>In Section 3 you learned about different communities of practice, and you could find further opportunities for learning in this way by:</p><ul class="oucontent-bulleted"><li>expanding the number and variety of groups that you belong to – for example, joining different social groups or community organisations </li><li>trying out new roles or activities within organisations to which you currently belong – for example, becoming treasurer of a club you belong to, or offering to stand in for one of the leaders at your local playgroup when they are on holiday.</li></ul><p>Either way, you can become acquainted with a wider range of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that you can observe, &#x2018;try on for size’ or discuss. You can open up your mind to challenging your own stereotypes and opinions – and those of others – and learn to value the debate and discussion that arises. You can sharpen your communication skills, while also acquiring new knowledge and information about the topic under discussion.</p><p>Neil Thompson (2005) has suggested that you can extend your knowledge and skills through six key routes: reading, asking, watching, feeling, talking and thinking.</p>
