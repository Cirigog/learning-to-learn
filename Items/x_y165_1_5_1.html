This section is an opportunity to reflect on what you have learned as a result of doing the unit. &#x2018;Reflecting backwards’ is an important part of learning because it helps you to be clear about what you have learned. Looking back also enables you to hold on to what you have learned after the unit finishes. This means that you can &#x2018;reflect forwards’ by thinking about what you might do in future and how this might be different from what you have done in the past.</p><p>Both reflecting backwards and reflecting forwards are important skills in their own right. It can be difficult to make the time to do either consciously or thoroughly. However, you have had a number of opportunities to practise reflection as you have worked through <i>Learning to learn.</i></p><p>Another way of thinking about this section is to see it as marking the start of the next phase in your learning. So far on this unit you have gone through the following sequence:</p><ol class="oucontent-numbered"><li style="list-style-type:decimal">You have &#x2018;taken stock’ of your own learning.</li><li style="list-style-type:decimal">You have considered what other perspectives and viewpoints have to offer.</li><li style="list-style-type:decimal">You have used what you have learned to move forward and try something new or different.</li></ol><p>This represents a cycle of learning. Now that you are reaching the end of <i>Learning to learn</i><i> </i>you are finishing this particular cycle. But we hope that you will see it as only the first on many such cycles of learning. This is why, later in this section, we discuss how you might create a CV for yourself. This can give you another starting point where you begin a new cycle by taking stock. However, before we move on to this we need to complete the cycle of learning you have been working on.</p><div class="oucontent-figure" style="width:511px;" id="fig032"><img src="y165_fig032.jpg" alt="Described image" longdesc="x_y165_1_longdesc_id394205318807.html"/><div class="oucontent-figure-text"><div class="oucontent-caption oucontent-nonumber"><span class="oucontent-figure-caption">Figure 32 Sequence of learning on Y165 so far</span></div></div><div class="oucontent-longdesclink oucontent-longdesconly"><a href="x_y165_1_longdesc_id394205318807.html">Long description</a></div><a name="longdesc_id394205318807" id="back_longdesc_id394205318807"></a></div>
