As we learn, we change, and as we change, our priorities may also change.</p><p>This does not mean that it is not worthwhile drawing up a plan. Having your goals written down reminds you to ask yourself on a regular basis: &#x2018;How am I doing?’, &#x2018;Is this really where I want to be right now?’, &#x2018;What other options are open to me?’, &#x2018;What might happen if I did X instead of Y?’ You are then in a position to update your plan on the basis of informed decision making. This is very different from drifting aimlessly, which might happen without a plan.</p><p>You should now be ready to implement a small part of your action plan, which is one focus of the following section. It would also be a good idea to begin thinking about how the viewpoints and theories that you have explored on this unit have helped you to develop and think about your plan.</p>
