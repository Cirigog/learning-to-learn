This second step is really about developing additional ways to build on the evidence you gathered about yourself in Section 2. In particular it considers how other people can help you change. There are two main aspects to this. The first is about involving other people so that you can get feedback from them and increase the depth of your own self-understanding. The second involves people who you meet only through what they have written. These people are academic writers who have suggested ways of thinking about learning that we hope you will find personally useful.</p><p>By the time you have reached the end of Section 3 you should be able to:</p><ul class="oucontent-bulleted"><li>use feedback to add information about your qualities, knowledge and skills from another perspective</li><li>use academic approaches to learning to increase your understanding of your qualities, knowledge and skills</li><li>reflect on the academic skills you have used.</li></ul>
