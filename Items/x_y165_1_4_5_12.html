//]]></script><p>Some people are much more open than others to making the changes in their life that lead to (or result from) learning and personal growth. Sometimes, it may feel easier to stay within our comfort zone, even though we are not satisfied with our life, than to venture out into new territory. Fiona Harrold suggests that we have to:</p><div class="oucontent-extract oucontent-s-siderule oucontent-s-box &#10;        oucontent-s-noheading&#10;      "><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><p>&#x2026; get used to feeling comfortable with a little discomfort and a little uncertainty alongside a great deal of positive expectancy. Turn anxiety into anticipation, fear into energy and worry into action.</p><div class="oucontent-source-reference">(Harrold, 2001, p. 281)</div></div></div></div><p>She explains that excitement and fear produce similar hormones: when the adrenalin surges through you, you can decide whether what you are feeling is excitement or fear. The more you live within your comfort zone, she adds, the harder it is to distinguish between the two because you have not had enough practice: &#x2018;To live your best life you have to move out of your comfort zone and learn to manage your feelings’ (Harrold, 2001, p. 281).</p><p>This leads us into the topic of emotional literacy which Susie Orbach (1999) has summarised neatly into a three Rs mnemonic involving the ability to:</p><ul class="oucontent-bulleted"><li>Register the emotional dimension in any situation – to recognise, for example, that there is an &#x2018;atmosphere’ and use it as a prompt to work out what is going on.</li><li>Recognise feelings of your own (and their effects on other people) and to &#x2018;read’ other people’s emotions accurately by interpreting their body language.</li><li>Respond appropriately to your own emotions and to those of other people. Recognising that sometimes it is appropriate to express your emotions and sometimes it is not; that sometimes it is appropriate to simply sit back and listen when other people lose their temper, burst into tears or whoop with joy, while at other times it is appropriate to challenge their interpretation of events. Some people know this intuitively but it is also a skill you can develop.</li></ul><p>Whenever you are making decisions there will be rational and emotional elements that you need to take into account. Traditionally, the emphasis has been on rational, logical thinking for decision making, but emotions can also provide you with useful &#x2018;data’. Sometimes a decision may appear rational but you are uncomfortable with it. Working out exactly what you are feeling – and what lies behind those feelings – can be a useful step towards deciding what to do next.</p><p>Thoughts, feelings and actions are interrelated – you can &#x2018;learn’ new emotional responses, just as you can learn new knowledge and skills.</p><p>There are various tools and techniques that you can use in developing emotional literacy. You might practise recognising your own emotions – and what leads to them – by keeping a &#x2018;mood journal’. You could include this as a part of the learning journal activity. This involves noting how you feel at different times of day, with different people and in different situations, to see if you can identify any patterns. When are you at your most and least anxious, happiest, annoyed and so on? This sort of activity can help you to recognise the way in which circumstances influence your emotions and how your feelings can influence a situation. You can recognise how your feelings can interfere with your thinking and how they can enhance it.</p><p>You might practise recognising other people’s emotions by making a conscious effort to interpret their body language and check it out with them – watching their gestures and saying: &#x2018;You’re looking [insert feeling], today’, with an inquiring tone that invites them to respond. Even if you are wrong in your interpretation, people are usually glad to be noticed and the following discussion might add to your knowledge of them and to your interpretation skills.</p><p>Build up your emotional vocabulary. Are you a little bit annoyed, cross, angry or absolutely furious? Are you calm, pleased, happy, delighted or ecstatic?</p><p>Having more words to think about how you feel can also help you to work out what to do with those feelings. In addition, Caruso and Salovey (2004) point out that emotions usually build up gradually, so if you can learn to recognise early warning signals of negative emotions you might be able to avert a difficult situation. For example, if you can spot someone feeling irritated, you may be able to find out what the problem is and discuss it before the feeling turns into anger or rage, which may be so strong they interfere with the ability to think rationally about the solution.</p><p>If you can spot your own feelings of apprehension, you can question why you are feeling that way and what you can do about it before you get to the terrified state in which you cannot think straight. Recognising that you have options is another element of emotional literacy. We can allow fear to paralyse us so that, for example, we always avoid giving presentations and ask other people to do them instead. Alternatively, we can note the feeling, but then use our thinking to work out exactly why we are afraid of doing presentations and to do something about it. We can practise making presentations until we have no need to be afraid.</p><p>By observing other people and noting the ways in which they respond differently to success and to failure, and asking them how they manage their emotions in situations that you always find difficult, you might be able to find more productive ways of handling your instinctive responses to events.</p><div class="&#10;            oucontent-activity&#10;           oucontent-s-heavybox1 oucontent-s-box " id="act052"><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><h2 class="oucontent-h3 oucontent-nonumber">Activity 52 Practising emotional literacy</h2><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><div class="oucontent-saq-timing">Allow about 40 minutes for this activity</div><div class="oucontent-saq-question"><p>Commit yourself to undertaking at least one of the above suggested routes to emotional literacy over the next week or so.</p><p>As another exercise, work on the three Rs. Think back to a recent time when you felt a particularly strong emotion. Now write as much about the feeling as you can (Recognising the feeling).</p><p>Next, work out how you could Respond appropriately. You might ask yourself the following questions:</p><ol class="oucontent-numbered"><li>Why did I feel this way?</li><li>Was this feeling helpful to me or not?</li><li>Was this feeling logical? Note the thoughts that accompanied the feelings (for example, &#x2018;I felt so useless’; &#x2018;I will never be able to do this’; &#x2018;I always do this wrong’).</li><li>Is there any evidence to support these thoughts or beliefs?</li><li>Is there any evidence that these thoughts are inaccurate?</li><li>How can I get a balanced view of this? (You might remind yourself of a time when you handled something really well, or you might imagine what you could do next time you feel this emotion.)</li><li>What options are open to me?</li></ol></div>

<div class="oucontent-saq-discussion"><h3 class="oucontent-h4 oucontent-discussionhasalias">Comment</h3><p>We hope that you have found it useful to stand back and think more closely about the link between thoughts, feelings and behaviours, and recognise that you can use your thinking to help you manage your feelings – but also use your feelings to prompt you into thinking about what you might usefully do next. If you identified that your automatic thoughts and feelings were not justified, it might be useful to write down your true qualities on a post-it note and put it somewhere you can look at it whenever you want. If you found that there was some justification for your thoughts and feelings, you might work out how to address any weaknesses in the knowledge and skills that led to the feelings so that you can avoid them in the future.</p></div></div></div></div><p>If you have been completing the activities as you worked through this section you should now be in a position to create your own action plan and to work out how you could monitor progress towards your goal or goals – the final topic for this section.</p>
