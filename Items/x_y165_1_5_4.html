//]]></script><p>Your qualities include some aspects that you might find difficult to talk about. We hope that your work on this unit has given you a clearer idea about these. They could include qualities like integrity and honesty, and they may link to some of your values – values that, perhaps, inform your vision and your action plan. How you use your improved awareness of your qualities is something that you may want to think about. You may be content to know that your qualities and values underpin your plans for change. On the other hand, you may decide that they have a wider currency and are something that you might want to share with other people. For example, you might want to make your qualities clear if you are applying for a job.</p><div class="&#10;            oucontent-activity&#10;           oucontent-s-heavybox1 oucontent-s-box " id="act056"><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><h2 class="oucontent-h3 oucontent-nonumber">Activity 56 Qualities I’ve developed</h2><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><div class="oucontent-saq-timing">Allow about 20 minutes for this activity</div><div class="oucontent-saq-question"><p>Spend a few moments thinking back over your learning while you have been on this unit.

You might still feel that it sounds boastful even to write them down. We hope that you feel that you are now more able to have an accurate and constructive picture of yourself. Not only does this mean that you can feel positive about yourself, it also means that you can share these feelings with other people when you need to.</p></div></div></div></div>
