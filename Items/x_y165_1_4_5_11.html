//]]></script><p>A learning journal does not have to be anything fancy. It can be just a few sheets of paper or a small note book that you can carry around with you or you can use an electronic one. It can help you look forwards by developing your ideas and plans for new learning experiences, and backwards by reflecting on your thoughts, feelings and actions about new activities you have tried. Thinking in terms of Thompson’s six elements, you might write down:</p><ul class="oucontent-bulleted"><li>your thoughts about articles that you have read</li><li>questions you would like to raise with people who might have more information or experience than you</li><li>your observations of other people in action, so that you get new ideas for trying out particular techniques or different responses to people’s demands of you</li><li>new ideas that you would like to test out in practice or discuss with people whose opinions you value</li><li>reflections on the results of trying out new things – did it work and why? Were there problems and what might be the cause of them?</li><li>how confident you are feeling about your learning and why</li><li>how you might build on your strengths and address your weaknesses.</li></ul><div class="&#10;            oucontent-activity&#10;           oucontent-s-heavybox1 oucontent-s-box " id="act051"><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><h2 class="oucontent-h3 oucontent-nonumber">Activity 51 Keeping a learning journal for five days</h2><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><div class="oucontent-saq-timing">Allow about 40 minutes for this activity over the five days you keep the journal</div><div class="oucontent-saq-question"><p>You might develop a chart in a part of the journal such as the one shown in Figure 31.</p><div class="oucontent-figure" style="width:511px;" id="fig031"><a href="x_y165_1_thumbnail_id394205318141.html" title="View larger image"><img src="y165_fig031.small.jpg" alt="Described image" longdesc="x_y165_1_longdesc_id394205318185.html"/></a><div class="oucontent-figure-text"><div class="oucontent-thumbnaillink"><a href="x_y165_1_thumbnail_id394205318141.html">View larger image</a></div><div class="oucontent-caption oucontent-nonumber"><span class="oucontent-figure-caption">Figure 31 Example diary extract</span></div></div><div class="oucontent-longdesclink oucontent-longdesconly"><a href="x_y165_1_longdesc_id394205318185.html">Long description</a></div><a name="longdesc_id394205318185" id="back_longdesc_id394205318185"></a><a name="thumbnail_id394205318141" id="back_thumbnail_id394205318141"></a></div></div>

<div class="oucontent-saq-discussion"><h3 class="oucontent-h4 oucontent-discussionhasalias">Comment</h3><p>The act of writing down your thoughts and feelings about your learning is valuable in itself – helping you to get things off your chest; to remind yourself to look for solutions to any problems; and to celebrate successes. Sometimes just the act of writing things down can clarify your ideas about what you would like to do about something. For example, making separate lists of the pros and the cons of a particular action can help you make a decision whether or not to go ahead.</p></div></div></div></div><p>Despite the undoubted value of keeping such a journal, we do recognise that it can be a difficult commitment to maintain. So, we would really like you to have a go, if only for a few days. We can even appeal on the basis of Entwistle’s approaches to learning. We think that a learning journal is an excellent way of practising a &#x2018;deep’ approach to your learning.</p><p>If you want to, you are very welcome to keep a learning journal for a longer period. This has the advantage of making it possible to review your entries on a regular basis – perhaps flicking through it once a month. This can help you to recognise:</p><ul class="oucontent-bulleted"><li>your progress, as you see that there are things that you used to find difficult but can now do relatively easily</li><li>recurring themes in your thoughts and actions which indicate potential areas to work on in the future.</li></ul><p>While there may be some very real and practical obstacles to learning and development – in the form of resources, knowledge and skills – there may also be times when our biggest obstacle is our own feelings and mindset, which leads us on to our third set of helping and hindering factors.</p>
