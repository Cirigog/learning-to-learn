The first of these sources has been other people that you know. The second has been a selection of &#x2018;academic’ theory that can be linked to learning. We hope that this has added to your knowledge and understanding of your own learning.</p><p>Here the focus shifts to gauging how your work with these two sources has used and (we hope) developed a number of your skills. As you know from your study of this section, &#x2018;skills’ is quite a loaded term. It is important to be clear about what skills we are talking about here. <i>Learning to learn</i><i> </i>refers to two different but related sets of skills. The first set is academic skills. The second set comprises those which you met in Section 2 – communication skills, problem solving skills and the skills involved in being organised. Let’s look at how you may have used each set in this section.</p>
