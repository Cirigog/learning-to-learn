Other people can look up to you and ask you to share your expertise. The process of moving from being a peripheral member to being a core member can also be very satisfying. However, groups are sometimes defined as much by whom they exclude. Groups may not just have &#x2018;insiders’; they have &#x2018;outsiders’ who are not seen as part of the group. Often this may not matter much. No one can be a member of every single group. However, being a member of some groups means that there is access to privileges that are denied to outsiders, who may be viewed as inferior or undesirable.</p><div class="oucontent-figure" style="width:511px;" id="fig022"><img src="y165_fig022.jpg" alt="Described image" longdesc="x_y165_1_longdesc_id394205315371.html"/><div class="oucontent-figure-text"><div class="oucontent-caption oucontent-nonumber"><span class="oucontent-figure-caption">Figure 22 Bell Hooks</span></div></div><div class="oucontent-longdesclink oucontent-longdesconly"><a href="x_y165_1_longdesc_id394205315371.html">Long description</a></div><a name="longdesc_id394205315371" id="back_longdesc_id394205315371"></a></div><p>American author bell hooks (she prefers her name to be given without capital letters) describes the effect of coming from a class and having an ethnicity that can lead to exclusion:</p><div class="oucontent-extract oucontent-s-siderule oucontent-s-box &#10;        oucontent-s-noheading&#10;      "><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><p>It was assumed that any student coming from a poor or working class background would willingly surrender all values and habits of being associated with this background.
