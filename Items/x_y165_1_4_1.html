You have gathered evidence about your current knowledge, skills and personal qualities. You have also explored the value of other perspectives on your learning. These perspectives have included the views of other people and the ideas in some academic theories. This section continues the exploration of academic ideas. In particular, it picks up on the issue that was first raised in Section 3 in relation to the theories of learning developed by psychologists. This is the problem that some theories from psychology tend to overlook the role played by wider society. To counter this, the section starts by looking at theories of globalisation and a theory known as &#x2018;human capital’.</p><p>In Section 4 we encourage you to think about the future – to set yourself some goals for your ongoing learning and development and to draw up an action plan for achieving them.</p><p>The first part of the section begins with a brief look at what we mean by an action plan. You will then be developing goals for the future and learning how to write these as clearly as possible. Having thought about what you are aiming for, you then need to think about what might help and hinder you – so that you can make a start on increasing your sources of help and support and reducing the obstacles. And, finally, we encourage you to think about drawing up an action plan and collecting evidence.</p><p>By the time you have reached the end of Section 4 you should be able to:</p><ul class="oucontent-bulleted"><li>explain how the wider social and political context may affect your learning</li><li>choose at least one goal that you would like to work towards and explain why you have chosen that goal</li><li>identify what you can do to help you achieve your goal</li><li>draw up a plan for achieving your goal</li><li>explain how you have used any ideas presented in the unit to identify your goals and develop your action plan, and comment on their usefulness to you.</li></ul>
