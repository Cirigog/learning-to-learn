//]]></script><p>It is worth spending some time thinking back over what you have learned from the unit materials. This unit has presented you with some challenging ideas and a wide range of perspectives. You have been asked to apply this to your own learning for change. As you look back over these, and at your responses to the activities, you will be reminded of the ground you have covered.</p><p>It may be helpful to think briefly about the perspectives that were the focus of each section:</p><ul class="oucontent-bulleted"><li>Section 1 introduced the unit outline and the three main perspectives on <i>Learning to learn.</i></li><li>Section 2 focused on your perspective as the basis for gathering evidence about your knowledge, skills and qualities.</li><li>Section 3 focused on the two remaining perspectives – other people and academic theory – as the basis for your learning.</li><li>Section 4   looked at the wider national and global context of learning. It then focused on how you could move forward by developing your vision and action plan.</li></ul><p>As you think back over what you have learned, you will probably remember some themes and ideas from the unit more easily than others. Perhaps there was an idea or way of thinking about change that you found particularly interesting or challenging. Perhaps something challenged you to look at yourself, or the world, in a different way. The next activity will help you focus on what you have learned from the unit materials.</p><div class="&#10;            oucontent-activity&#10;           oucontent-s-heavybox1 oucontent-s-box " id="act054"><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><h2 class="oucontent-h3 oucontent-nonumber">Activity 54 Learning to learn – knowledge</h2><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><div class="oucontent-saq-timing">Allow about 20 minutes for this activity</div><div class="oucontent-saq-question"><p>Think back over the unit. Try and think of three things that you have learned from the unit materials. You might include how your work on the unit has made you think differently about yourself. You could say how developing a vision has changed your own thinking.</p><p>One person wrote:</p><ol class="oucontent-numbered"><li style="list-style-type:decimal">I have learned about the importance of other people.</li><li style="list-style-type:decimal">The case studies showed me that ordinary people can achieve change in their lives.</li><li style="list-style-type:decimal">I was really motivated by having a vision to work towards.</li></ol></div>

<div class="oucontent-saq-discussion"><h3 class="oucontent-h4 oucontent-discussionhasalias">Comment</h3><p>Making clear what you have learned at this point in time makes it much easier to use in the future as the basis for your &#x2018;reflecting forwards’. By reminding you of which aspects of the unit you found most interesting, you will have a better idea of what you want to build on and take further.</p></div></div></div></div>
