//]]></script><p>Communication can be approached in terms of the skills needed to get a hoped-for response. By seeing communication in terms of skills, it is easier to focus on what skills you already have and use. Once you have a reasonably clear picture about this, it is much easier to see where you might want to act to increase your communication strengths and decrease any weaknesses.</p><p>It can be useful to try assessing what you see as someone else’s communication skills before you think about your own. It is for this reason that the next two activities ask you to assess the communication skills of Karen and Shehnaz.</p><div class="&#10;            oucontent-activity&#10;           oucontent-s-heavybox1 oucontent-s-box " id="act015"><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><h2 class="oucontent-h3 oucontent-nonumber">Activity 15 Reflecting on Karen’s verbal communication skills</h2><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><div class="oucontent-saq-timing">Allow about 20 minutes for this activity</div><div class="oucontent-saq-question"><span class="oucontent-editorcomment">Videos to come</span><p>Watch the Case Studies video below. Watch it a few times in order to build up a detailed picture of Karen’s communication skills. This activity focuses on the ways that Karen uses words and language – her verbal behaviour. Use the checklist that follows to identify four key aspects of Karen’s verbal communication:</p><ul class="oucontent-bulleted"><li>Speed – Did Karen talk quickly or slowly?</li><li>Tone – What tone of voice did Karen use? Did this convey anything about how she was feeling?</li><li>Pitch – Did Karen talk in a high or in a low pitch? What messages did this send?</li><li>Loudness – How loud was Karen? Again, what messages did you think she sent as a result?</li></ul></div>

<div class="oucontent-saq-discussion"><h3 class="oucontent-h4 oucontent-discussionhasalias">Comment</h3><p>Neil Thompson (1996) has pointed out that these verbal aspects of communication can all give important clues about how people are feeling. So it is not just what people say that counts, it is how people say it too. If someone seems to talk rather quickly, this may be because they are angry or worried. In contrast, if someone speaks slowly this may be because they are tired. Or it may indicate a lack of confidence in what they have to say. It is also possible to interpret why people may use a particular tone of voice. As Thompson (1996, p. 83) points out, tone of voice is &#x2018;an important indicator of emotional state. It gives important messages about how the person is feeling. It indicates a whole range of feelings: anger, sadness, joy &#x2026;’.</p><p>Similar comments may be made about pitch. Thompson suggests that:</p><div class="oucontent-extract oucontent-s-siderule oucontent-s-box &#10;        oucontent-s-noheading&#10;      "><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><p>flat, unmodulated pitch can reflect a depressed mood, while high or fluctuating pitch can signal &#x2026; anger, fear or excitement.</p><div class="oucontent-source-reference">Thompson (1996, pp. 83–84)</div></div></div></div><p>Thompson (1996, p. 84) suggests that quiet speech can indicate a lack of confidence, fear or anxiety whereas loud speech can suggest aggression or a lack of sensitivity. Loud speech may also be used by someone who is fearful or anxious.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="&#10;            oucontent-activity&#10;           oucontent-s-heavybox1 oucontent-s-box " id="act016"><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><h2 class="oucontent-h3 oucontent-nonumber">Activity 16 Reflecting on Shehnaz’s non-verbal communication skills</h2><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><div class="oucontent-saq-timing">Allow about 20 minutes for this activity</div><div class="oucontent-saq-question"><span class="oucontent-editorcomment">Video to come</span><p>Watch the Case Studies video below. This time your focus needs to be on Shehnaz’s non-verbal behaviour. As Shehnaz appears in a number of other video extracts you may also wish to watch some of these to help you think about her non-verbal communication skills.</p><p>Non-verbal communication can occur in many different ways. For example, the way that we dress will result in non-verbal communication occurring. Even objects that we have around us can be the basis of non-verbal messages being sent. How close we are when talking with someone is another important aspect of non-verbal communication, as is the way that touch is used. However, in this activity we would like you to identify the following three aspects of Shehnaz’s non-verbal communication:</p><ul class="oucontent-bulleted"><li>Facial expression   – What facial expressions did Shehnaz use? What messages did they convey?</li><li>Eye contact – What sort of eye contact did Shehnaz appear to be having with the person who was talking to her? What effects do you think this had?</li><li>Posture – What posture did Shehnaz adopt? What messages did this result in?</li></ul></div>

<div class="oucontent-saq-discussion"><h3 class="oucontent-h4 oucontent-discussionhasalias">Comment</h3><p>Facial expressions, according to Thompson (1996, p. 95), &#x2018;are very powerful in conveying information’. In particular smiling &#x201C;can be a highly significant form of communication&#x201D;. As far as eye contact is concerned, it is important not to have too much eye contact as this can be seen as challenging or threatening. On the other hand, too little eye contact can be interpreted as indicating that someone is not trustworthy. It is important to note that these interpretations can vary from one culture to another. Some cultures see it as being polite to avoid eye contact as far as possible.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="&#10;            oucontent-activity&#10;           oucontent-s-heavybox1 oucontent-s-box " id="act017"><div class="oucontent-outer-box"><h2 class="oucontent-h3 oucontent-nonumber">Activity 17 Communication skills – their overall impact</h2><div class="oucontent-inner-box"><div class="oucontent-saq-timing">Allow about 25 minutes for this activity</div><div class="oucontent-saq-question"><p>We hope that the two activities involving Karen and Shehnaz will have given you a &#x2018;feel’ for the sorts of communication skills that are important in helping us to understand what another person communicates to us. This should put us in a better position to communicate with them. Think back to either Activity 15 (which involved Karen) or Activity 16 (which focused on Shehnaz). You can always, if you wish, go back to the same video extracts that you watched for these activities.</p><p>Note down your answers to these questions:</p><ol class="oucontent-numbered"><li style="list-style-type:decimal">Did you think that Karen or Shehnaz communicated well with the person who was talking to her in the video extract? (Please note that you did not hear the interviewer’s voice on the video.)</li><li style="list-style-type:decimal">Which aspects of verbal and non-verbal communication do you think might help Karen or Shehnaz communicate successfully with other people? (This could relate to people she works with or other people, such as family members.)</li><li style="list-style-type:decimal">Were there any aspects of her communication skills that you think it might be useful for Karen or Shehnaz to improve?</li></ol></div>

<div class="oucontent-saq-discussion"><h3 class="oucontent-h4 oucontent-discussionhasalias">Comment</h3><p>Assessing someone’s communication skills is always going to be difficult as different interpretations are always possible. It is not always easy to decide which interpretation is &#x2018;true’. The point is to become as aware as possible about the messages that other people are sending out so that you can improve the likelihood of reasonably successful communication. Let’s see what Karen has to say about her communication skills.</p><div class="oucontent-quote oucontent-s-box"><blockquote><p>Karen</p><div class="oucontent-figure" style="width:511px;"><img src="y165_figu001.jpg" alt=""/></div><p>I think I have learned how to read body language when I am speaking to people – more observant. People don’t always say how they are feeling, so if you can read their body language it’s easier to pick up on things. I am probably more confident with my questioning. I am listening and taking in the messages I am receiving from people and also giving them a lot more opportunity to make their own choices.</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div>
