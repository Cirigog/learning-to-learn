We hope that you have found that you have a combination of knowledge, skills and qualities that you can take forward in ways that will help you feel fulfilled in whatever you decide to do and will make your life more interesting and enjoyable.</p><p>We also hope that you have begun to feel that in addition to being able to manage change in your life you can also successfully study at the level of higher education. The academic skills you have built up on this unit will stand you in good stead with many other units and we hope that this means that, although you are finishing <i>Learning to learn,</i> this is only just the start for other, perhaps longer, units of study. We also hope that it marks the start of many exciting changes in your life.</p><p>Good luck and best wishes as you go on learning to learn.</p>
