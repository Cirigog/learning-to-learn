If you are not clear, your goal may be open to different interpretations and you may become unsure of what you intended. For example, suppose you chose a goal like &#x2018;to get better at giving people feedback’. This could be interpreted in at least two ways:</p><ol class="oucontent-numbered"><li style="list-style-type:decimal">To improve your self-confidence about giving feedback, so that you no longer get nervous about having to do it.</li><li style="list-style-type:decimal">To improve your success rate in giving feedback so that the people on the receiving end do what you ask of them without getting angry, resentful or fearful – or you feel able to enter into a rational discussion of alternatives with them if they do not agree it needs doing.</li></ol><p>The important thing here is to be as clear as possible, so you might want to have a couple of goes at writing a goal to check that it can only be interpreted in one way. So rather than just saying &#x2018;get better at giving feedback’, you might write down something like &#x2018;provide feedback to two people without feeling nervous while doing it’.</p><p>This would mean that you look for different things in monitoring your progress – which leads us into the next element.</p>
