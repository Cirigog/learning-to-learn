However, the key question is: What have you learned that you did not know when you started Section 1? When you reach the end of a section it is a good idea to review the work you have completed.</p><p>Although most people feel fairly confident reading steadily through a section from start to finish, there will be situations where it is more important to read through quickly to identify a key bit of information, or to look through several sections to get an overall view of the main ideas. In these cases, reading every sentence carefully would not be appropriate and would waste quite a lot of time.</p><p>Suppose you wanted to find one bit of information quickly, for example â€“ some fact that you knew you had read about in the current section. What would you do? One way would be to look at the contents list or flick quickly through the sections, reading the headings and subheadings. The first sentence in each paragraph often introduces the main idea too. Or, if you have a good idea where you read the information initially, you can quickly glance through it just looking for that one piece of information.</p>
